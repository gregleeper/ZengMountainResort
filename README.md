# ZengMountainResort

An e-commerce site for the best Skiing resort this side of the Mississippi. 

The patterns used to build the site are modeled after the 'NetBeans E-Commerce Tutorial' https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/javaee/ecommerce/intro.html

__always cite your sources__ 
If the citation is for a web app, doesn't that make it a __site-ation__?
